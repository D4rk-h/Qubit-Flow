## Quantum Properties and Algorithms Behavior

A Java-based quantum computing simulation library for understanding quantum mechanics through hands-on implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project is my journey from data science into quantum computing. As a self-taught quantum enthusiast, I'm building this library to understand and demonstrate quantum properties and algorithms behavior through interactive experimentation rather than abstract mathematics alone.

## ðŸ“š Educational Foundation
This implementation is primarily based on concepts from:

"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen & Chuang - The foundational textbook that guided this project's theoretical framework
